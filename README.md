# Predicting-Student-Performance

Four Machine Learning Algorithms namely-
- k-Nearest Neighbors
- Decision Trees
- Naive Bayes 
- Artificial Neural Network 
are applied on the Student Performance Dataset. The Dataset, taken from the UCI ML Repository, consists of 33 extracted features of a student (its age, parent's qualification, etc) and 1 output class (whether the student will drop or not). 

# Dependencies
Install scikit-learn, Theano, TensorFlow, Keras using  `pip install library_name`

# Usage
Run each python file by  `python file_name.py`
