# Predicting-Student-Performance

Four Machine Learning Algorithms namely k-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes and Artificial Neural Network is applied on the Student Performance Dataset. The Dataset, taken from the UCI ML Repository, consists of 33 extracted features of a student (its age, parent's qualification, etc) and 1 output class (whether the student will drop or not).
